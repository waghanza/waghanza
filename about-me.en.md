## Hide me

Welcome abroad. 

In this document, I try to get deeper abouit value that I can bring to your company (or your customer's one).

It is not an easy thing to detect a professional potential with a flat support, like a _CV_.

Most of digital projects fails, not because of technical issues, but because of a lack of communications / values alignement between any professional and company that hires him, les **softs skills**.


##  Who am I ? 

> in a few words ...

Marwan, 35 year, I am in software creation since 15 years now. I keep focus on software **maintainability**, some call it having a _Clean Architecture_

My main goal (at least the one I want to take) is not being a code writer, but understand what are customer issues and how I can solve them.

I am in **Ruby**land - mosly using **Ruby on Rails** - since more than _10 years_ so I have such an expertise on that technology.

Therefore I'm open to learn new tech if needed.

+ Decision making helper, when choosing a new stack

## My requirements

+ **Localisation** : full remote or **Lyon** based
+ **Compensation** : 600€ TJM for a contract / 75K per year for a long term employment
+ **Autonomy** : To solve any of your problems, I have to deeply understand the need of your customers.
> During my experiments, I have learned that too manydigital projects are failing due to over-engineered solutions
- **Pedagogy** : I am deeply convinced that a project could not (at least on a long term shot) be handled on my own. That why I have acquired a sens of communication and knowledge sharing inside a benevolant team.
- **Technology** : I am a **Ruby** expert, either *front* or *back*. I can also be a **DevOps** with some tool like [terraform](https://www.terraform.io). Open to new tech by the way. 


:information_source: The most important requirements are : **compensaton** and **remote**. The others are mostly subjectives, depending on the client context
