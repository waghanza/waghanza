## Hide me

Welcome abroad. 

In this document, I try to get deeper abouit value that I can bring to your company (or your customer's one).

It is not an easy thing to detect a professional potential with a flat support, like a _CV_.

Most of digital projects fails, not because of technical issues, but because of a lack of communications / values alignement between any professional and company that hires him, les **softs skills**.


##  Who am I ? 

> in a few words ...

Marwan, 35 year, I am in software creation since 15 years now. I keep focus on software **maintainability**, some call it having a _Clean Architecture_

My main goal (at least the one I want to take) is not being a code writer, but understand what are customer issues and how I can solve them.

I am in **Ruby**land - mosly using **Ruby on Rails** - since more than _10 years_ so I have such an expertise on that technology.

Therefore I'm open to learn new tech if needed.

## SÃ©lection de mes projets

+ https://github.com/the-benchmarker/web-frameworks

Web framework benchmark. This projects has two main goals :

+ Explore new techs, and how they perform
+ Decision making helper, when choosing a new stack

## My requirements

+ **Localisation** : full remote or **Lyon** based
+ **Compensation** : 600â‚¬ TJM for a contract / 75K per year for a long term employment
+ **Autonomy** : To solve any of your problems, I have to deeply understand the need of your customers.
> During my experiments, I have learned that too manydigital projects are failing due to over-engineered solutions
- **Pedagogy** : I am deeply convinced that a project could not (at least on a long term shot) be handled on my own. That why I have acquired a sens of communication and knowledge sharing inside a benevolant team.
- **Technology** : I am a **Ruby** expert, either *front* or *back*. I can also be a **DevOps** with some tool like [terraform](https://www.terraform.io). Open to new tech by the way. 


:information_source: The most important requirements are : **compensaton** and **remote**. The others are mostly subjectives, depending on the client context


## Which value can I bring ?

I can almost argue with my differents strategies / approches, I can not garantee it will work on you context. Like in investment, I can say that _Past performance is no guarantee of future results_.

However, I can expose you my step-by-step strategy to understand **your** business context :rocket: :

#### First(s) week(s)

+ Getting in touch with team members
> What interest me is **human**, that could help with _management_
+ Small contributions to callibrate the approach to adopt
+ Deeper discussions with my teammeated to put forward team strength :strong:

#### Major contributions

+ More business valuable tasks
+ Security audit
+ Onbarding new members 
> I find that DX (Developer eXperience) is very important, and often a key of success


## Moving forward

+ Build custom development process, related to business context
> Spot bottleneck and try to remove them (bottleneck could be opposed to scalability)
+ Formal meeting with each team members
> To make sure that each teammate could have a clear career path in this company

## My pledge

:information_source: Curiosity & learning

A key of success is to **know** each person you are working with. 


## My anti-pledge

In companies I had work with I have seen many scenarios that could lead to toxic athmosphere

+ Impose instead of _propose_
+ Put pressure on instead of _trust_
+ Find a five legged sheep instead of a _specialist_
+ Bring ahead mistaks instead of _find / solving the causes_

## Deeper discussion ?

Thanks for you time, I hope this bring you some interest
